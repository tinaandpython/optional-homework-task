# optional-homework-task

# Write a class "Student" with attributes "name" and "credits".
# The name can be any name, and credits can range from 0 to 30.
# Write a method for the class that prints the student's name and credits.
# The method should only perform information printing (no other logic).

# The name and credits should be assignable during initialization:

# s = Student("Mantas", -5)

# If credits are assigned as 0 or less (e.g., -66), set them to 0.

# If credits are assigned as 30 or more (e.g., 66), set them to 30.

# Use @property and @property.setter decorators.
